## 💼 Featured Projects

### 1. Data Wrangling for Semi-Structured Data
[![View Project](https://img.shields.io/badge/View-Project-success?style=flat-square&logo=github)](https://github.com/huypa/Portfolio-Data-Wrangling/blob/main/README.md)

Developed a comprehensive text data wrangling and pre-processing pipeline to transform semi-structured XML records and unstructured YouTube comments into structured datasets for database integration and NLP tasks.

**Key Features:**
- Regex-based parsing and text cleaning
- Tokenization, stemming, and feature engineering
- JSON outputs with vocabularies and count vectors

**📈 Result:** Achieved **99/100** score for accuracy and code quality

### 2. Data Processing for Big Data
