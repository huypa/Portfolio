<h2>👨‍💻 Data Analysis Projects:</h2>

- <b>Data Wranngling for semi-structured data</b>
  - [Data Wranngling for semi-structured data](https://github.com/huypa/Portfolio-Data-Wrangling/blob/main/README.md): Developed a text data wrangling and pre-processing pipeline to transform semi-structured XML records and unstructured YouTube comments into structured datasets for database integration and NLP tasks. Implemented regex-based parsing, text cleaning, tokenisation, stemming, and feature engineering to generate JSON outputs, vocabularies, and count vectors with a score of 99/100 from tutor.
- <b>Data processing for big data</b>
  - [Data processing for big data](https://github.com/huypa/Portfolio-Big-Data-Processing): Built a scalable fraud detection system combining Apache Kafka, PySpark Structured Streaming, and ML. In Part A, developed fraud prediction models (GBT, RF) with AUC > 0.9 and profiled fraudster behaviour using K-Means. In Part B, deployed the model in real time with Kafka–Spark pipelines, producing fraud alerts, product insights, and live dashboards. Delivered an end-to-end prototype integrating big data processing, streaming, and applied machine learning.

- <b>Data analytics for semi-structured data</b>
  - [Data analytics for semi-structured data](https://github.com/huypa/Portfolio-Data-analytics-for-semi-structured-data/tree/main): Built text classifiers (Logistic Regression, RNN) and LDA topic models on arXiv papers, comparing abstracts vs. titles and uncovering key themes like neural networks, HCI, and reinforcement learning.
